### Head of Production Optimization and Maintenance Management ðŸ¦„

In my role as head of the production optimization and maintenance management group, I advance
current application-oriented research topics to enable sustainable and digital transformation in
maintenance. The thematic cornerstones are

- Artificial Intelligence in maintenance through the use of predictive maintenance models and
chatbots
- Retrofit and edge devices for agile data collection and analysis
- Maintenance-as-a-Service approaches for assets, including parts management and refurbishment
- Integrated maintenance planning for linked production through mathematical modeling and
Bayesian networks
